## Speed

Words per Minute (wpm). This only counts _clear_ speech at the stated rates.

| Speaker               | Words per Minute (wpm) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Ordinary conversation | 120 – 150              |
| Radio/podcast host    | 150 – 160              |
| Auctioneer            | 250                    |
| Sports commentator    | 250 – 400              |
| World record          | ~650                   |

Pathfinder and D&D combat is in 6 second intervals, assuming fast speech, you'd get 160 – 250 wpm, which is ~200/10 = 20 words per round total for all speakers in one combat round. Double for sports commentator speed. These speeds however assume you are fully committed to speaking and nothing else, so we can make good assumption that strenuous activity, dodging incoming attacks, shouting magical words of power will _at minimum_ halve this if not more, running into assumption of 10 to 20 total words per full round by all involved in the exchange during which everyone gets their turn.
