# Speeds

Random sciency factoids collected by Mana#4176

## Ambulation

Human movement speeds on average:

- Walking is 5 km/h (1.4 m/s; 4.59 ft/s, 3.1 mph)
- Jogging is ?? (double?)
- Running is ??? (triple?)
- Sprinting is 37.58 km/h (10.44 m/s; 34.25 ft/s; 23.35 mph) – world record is 44.72 km/h (27.8 mph)

## Vehicular

### Mechanical

- Bicycles go about ??? (44-ish??)
- Motorcycles go about ??? (80–120km/h???)
- Fast cars go about 400 – 480 km/h (250 – 300 mph)
- Supersonic jets go about 1905.81 knots (3529.6 km/h; 2193.2 mph)

### Medieval

- Horse drawn carriage is about 16 – 24 km/h (10 – 15 mph) for 2 hours.

- - More horses generally allow the carriage to be drawn longer, not faster.
  - If the weight of the cargo is low enough or there's enough horses, the speed may double.

### Early modern

- Automobile moved at about 16 km/h (10 mph)

### Modern

- Tractors move at 40 km/h (25 mph) though normally much slower.
- Cars move at speeds of around 80 – 128 km/h (50 – 80 mph).
- Trucks generally move at lower end of car speeds but have incredible mass in comparison.

## Natural phenomena

* Sound goes at about 1234.8 km/h (343 m/s; 767 mph)

## Natural world top speeds

Mind, this is sprinting (not sustained) speeds.

- Domestic cat is 48 km/h (30 mph)
- Wolf is 50 – 60 km/h (40 mph)
- Greyhound is 72 km/h (45 mph)
- Quarter horse is 88 km/h (55 mph)
- Cheetah is 100 km/h (62 mph)

On average sustained high speed is about 50 – 60% of top speed (e.g. wolf can do sustained run of 25 mph for 2 miles, compared to sprinting at 40 mph).
