## **Vehicles**

### Medieval

- Horse drawn carriage is about 16 – 24 km/h (10 – 15 mph) for 2 hours.

- - More horses generally allow the carriage to be drawn longer, not faster.
  - If the weight of the cargo is low enough or there's enough horses, the speed may double.

### Early modern

- Automobile moved at about 16 km/h (10 mph)

### Modern

- Tractors move at 40 km/h (25 mph) though normally much slower.
- Cars move at speeds of around 80 – 128 km/h (50 – 80 mph).
- Trucks generally move at lower end of car speeds but have incredible mass in comparison.
