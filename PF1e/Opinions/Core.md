# Opinions

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

This is just to record bunch of opinions I have about the system.

For now poorly organized.

## Problems early game

- **Character skills are bad**. Potential solution: Background skills.
- **Instasquish**. This is both good and bad, but since PF is supposed to be high fantasy, this seems utterly wrong for PCs. Potential solution: grant some 6-10 extra starting HP.
- **Action options are incredibly limited**, this is why I keep saying most classes get off around level 4-5 because that's when you Get options. AoOs are major cause for this, it's just not worth taking the hits. Potential solution: Always start at later levels.
- **Early magic stays early magic**. It's weak but works early game but has no place late game, so it feels like whatever you're using early game for "flair" can't keep that up unless you build one of those dumb super powered shocking grasp builds. Potential solution: Need new magic.
- **Rolling for health** seems only good for high lethality campaigns. Rules for boosting this seem pointless unless you really want to waste time and money retraining. Potential solution: Adapt 2e's max health stance, or make the roll more meaningful than delayed max health.
- **Consumables are super expensive** considering the economy, even weak ones, so you have to be really well off to even consider them instead of saving for more permanent things. Potential solution: Redo consumable pricing.
- **Lacking skills** generally means I don't even try some things, because I have limited ability to improve the circumstantial bonuses enough to matter. Potential solution: Be more explicit about DCs and favor ordinary (DC 5-15) challenges unless something extremely unusual is attempted.
- **Failure is harsher than not trying** in many cases. Potential solution: ??
- **XP mostly from fights** creates weird problems for self improvement.
- **Below level 3-5 character** is someone who should still be in training. Both because their skills can't usually cover backgrounds in all classes and because they're so incompetent, trying to get the basics. They're tutorial levels for Pathfinder itself, even. This is more obvious with Gygax himself NEVER starting games that low, because they're for new players.

## Problems late game:

- **Big numbers** and lack of them means failure.
- Spongyness, or super optimal builds that make the sponginess feel like level 1 noobness.

## General problems:

- **Repeating same action** is often the only real choice in combat. There's no competing actions that are of equal value most of the time. UnMonk is good at trying to get away from this, but even they fall short.
- As player I have **no way to gauge encounters**. Only thing I can do is go with what GM explicitly says about such things. Generally this leads to weird can I do something about this or not and if not why?
- **Counterspelling** is still useless.
- **Level up instant power-ups** are just weird. It should be gradual process outside of epiphany stuff. Some lampshade this often, but to me it's very immersion breaking, especially when character start talking about it.
- **Levels** grant both breadth of skills as well as deepness, it's great for power fantasy but for anything else it's not.
- **Favored Class Bonuses are too good** in some cases, dictating race choice completely for some classes. I'd rather have the choice freely choosable so I'm no longer locked to some race choices just because of their too good choice. This would allow mix and matching of bonuses, too. Races are less flavored with each class, but that should be race flavor, not class building flavor.
- Racial feats, crafting feats, and **many utility feats compete with combat feats**. 2e has his partially solved with distinction and separate progression with 4 types of feats. Potential solution: Adopt approach that allows extra non-combat feats to be gained.
- **Traits are kinda meh** outside of couple of choices that are interesting, and they're usually campaign traits which we never are allowed to take. We should make our own, or just not bother with traits.

## Problems with classes

- **Full BAB classes** vs others. This makes it harder to multi-class and necessitates the weird but common touch AC part of many spells to counter it from different angle. Potential solution: Give everyone full BAB. Increase everyone's Touch AC by half or perhaps quarter their level. Alternatively give 1/2 bab classes 3/4 progression and give everyone variable 1-5 bonus to Touch AC.
- **Martials are boring**.
- **X per day abilities** are often meh because of the limitation. Not all of them tho, like heal per day limitation is fine.
- **Resource pools** are usually really small, only good for one moderately challenging fight. Especially magus and monk resource pools. Gunslinger grit is fine-ish due to you having active ways to regain it. Arcanist has large pool and usually not an issue. Psychic phrenic pool is Tiny, but you don't have too much use for it.
- **Low tier** **bloodline powers** and **mystery revelations** are usually worthless. (1d6+Â½CL damage 3 times per day at 30 ft if you hit? How scary; grow weak pitiful claws for couple of rounds? etc.)
- Some **base class features** are super meh except in very specific circumstances, e.g. Smite Evil.
- Multiple **familiar**, eidolon, animal companion, and similar **sources interact poorly**. Singular sources discourage multi-classing hard.
- Very **similar abilities don't stack** either in function or their pool in any way.

## Problems with game mechanics

- **Binary success** and failure. Improved by introducing grades of success, but also by introducing failing/succeeding forward.
- **Pointless feat chains**. Why do you need light armor proficiency to get medium armor proficiency and heavy armor proficiency?
- **Missing actions**. There' s potential for more actions to exist but they don't. Say aiming or attacking recklessly.
- Vancian magic.
- **Social encounters** and other similar problems usually completely divorce what's happening from the mechanics. It's like the time to forget we're even playing Pathfinder at those times.
- **[Houserule-specific] Hero points** being super limited so it encourages saving for Those moments, thus you never use them. Especially after few levels where they have to last through a Lot of events. This is made worse by the level-up only restoration.

## Problems with equipment

- Some **weapons** just make fuckall sense (sword is slashing only, can't poke with the tip no matter how much you try). Exotic weapons are never used because they require really dumb and specific builds to put to use.
- **Interesting weapons** are super expensive and tend to be epic level items. You're fighting with spoons and firecrackers until then.
- "My character should've known to take that with us." Partial solution: Packrat feat kinda helps with this, but at cost of a highly valuable feat.

## Potential fixes

- **Unchained Action Economy** can potentially help with some of the problems.
- Missing by little bit (3-5) still does minimum damage of the weapon. Like you'd normally hit for 1d8 + Str + 1d6 Fire + Arcane Strike you instead just deal 1. Would be buffed to 2 or 3 for greatsword and large bastard sword respectively (because 2d6 and 3d6). Or could be just flat 1 damage for all weapons. Maybe 1 + off-hand Str.
