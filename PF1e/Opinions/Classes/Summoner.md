#### Complaints

- You can only be healed by others after you've lost more than half your health.
- You are the ONLY one who can heal you.
- You don't have access to offensive spellcasting while putting out your full-attack, nor to buffing without delaying your damage, though this leaves your spellcasting for utility.
- You don't have access to summoner attacking/flanking with the eidolon.
- Armor is completely disabled while Eidolon is summoned, no feature of the armor are active. And there’s no way around this.
- Base forms are limited to humanoid (unless you’re small). This also limits available evolutions. This is debatable limitation, depending how you read the restrictions.
