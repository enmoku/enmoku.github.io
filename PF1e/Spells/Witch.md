Some of the spells may be slightly lower level than they should be.

## Bestial visage

School: Transmutation; Level: Witch 3, Cleric 3, Wizard/Sorcerer 3, Druid 3, Ranger 3  
Casting time: Standard  
Components: V, S, DF/F [part of a beast]  
Range: Touch  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Saving throw: Fort negates (harmless); Spell resistance: Yes (harmless)  
The subject gains features of the beast which’s part was used, growing hairier or feathered, face turns into a malformed half-muzzle or beak, nails grow into claws and such. Growing fiercer and more menacing they gain +2 to Intimidate checks, their movement speed related to the beast increases by 5 feet, their unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and +4 Strength, and -2 to their attack rolls.

## Lightwisps

School: Conjuration [Creation, Light]; Level: Bard 1, Witch 1, Wizard/Sorcerer 1, Cleric 1, Ranger 1, Druid 1  
Casting time: Standard  
Components: V, S, F (Light source, lit or not)  
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)  
Effects: 1 wisp per 2 levels  
Duration: Concentration + 10 minutes  
Saving throw: None; Spell resistance: No  
The spell creates a number of diminutive flying wisps, that on closer inspection resemble drowsy pixies, that each emit a random dim light within 5 feet radius. The wisps can be darkened as swift action and relit as standard. For each three wisps occupying the same space, the light level is increased by one and the radius by 5 feet, but each step beyond the first 5 feet is darker than the last. The wisps fly at speed of 30 feet and have perfect maneuverability, going wherever the caster wills them to move. They can not enter liquids nor solids. Each wisp has 1 hit point and 16 AC, are mindless and use their summoner’s saves as if held objects.  
	When the summoner stops concentrating on the spell, the wisps start wandering aimlessly until the spell ends.

## Alluring presence

School: Enchantment [Charm, Mind-affecting]; Level: Bard 1, Witch 1, Wizard/Sorcerer 2  
Casting time: Standard  
Components: S, F (scrap of silk or vial containing makeup)  
Range: Touch  
Targets: One creature  
Effects: Subject gains +4 to Diplomacy, Bluff and Charisma checks.   
Duration: 1 round/level; see text  
Saving throw: Will negates (semi-harmless); Spell resistance: Yes (semi-harmless)  
Subject becomes much more attractive to onlookers, making others overlook the worse and focus on the better qualities, thus the subject’s appearance is unchanged. Even flaws in one’s voice and odor are treated similarly.

## Wildgrowth

School: Transmutation; Level: Witch 2, Druid 1, Ranger 1, Cleric 2, Wizard/Sorcerer 2  
Casting time: Full round  
Components: V, S, M/DF (seeds)  
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)  
Effect: anchored spread of bramble, up to 5 feet square / 2 levels  
Duration: Instant  
Saving throw: Fort negates (harmless); Spell resistance: Yes (harmless)  
A wild thicket of vines and branches grows starting from caster’s adjacent square and farther. Requires small batch of viable growing ground. Each square is 5 feet tall unless there’s a solid support on one of its adjacent squares, growing additional 5 feet up if the higher position still maintains the support. A thicket can support another thicket in such manner.  
	The thicket counts as difficult terrain and requires squeezing through ever anything larger than tiny. Each square of the thicket has 2 hardness and 2 hit points per level (to maximum of 6 hit points). The caster may strengthen portions of the thicket by doubling the thickets in the same square, doubling its hardness, thickness and hit points. This thickness can be further increased but it does not increase its durability.  
	If anchored from two ends, it can be used to create a vine bridge or similar structure that supports up to 25 lbs plus 5 lbs every 2 caster levels and further multiplied with each overlapping thicket.  
	Alternatively the spell can be used to cause plants to grow wildly in the affected area. Although nothing grows to state to being ready to harvest unless it would take less than month to do so naturally. Larger plants grow as if they had aged by 1 month per 6 caster levels and portions of thereof.  
	This has no effect on plant creatures besides perhaps fluffing up their plumage.  
	The thicket remains indefinitely assuming the plant from which seeds it was grown can flourish in the area in the way it was grown. If no seeds are used, it grows from whatever already is there. Although nature check will reveal the thicket to be unnatural, it is also harmless depending on the seeds used.

## Unrestrained emotion

School: Enchantment [Emotion, Mind-affecting]; Level: Witch 2, Bard 1, Cleric 2  
Casting time: Standard action  
Components: V, S  
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)  
Targets: One creature  
Duration: Concentration + 1 round  
Saving throw: Will negates; Spell resistance: Yes  
Target is forced to experience any emotions they’ve been holding back or those they’ve recently experienced in their fullest.
Roll 1d6 to see effects each round. 1) Shaken 2-3) Attack nearest enemy or if no enemies around, grapple an ally. 4-5) Sob or rage uncontrollably 6) Act as if affected by slow spell.  
Subject may not make full round actions but may otherwise function as much as they can outside of these actions.
Subject also gains +2 to saving throws against other mind-affecting spells for the duration and one round after.

### Notes

There might be spell like this already.  
Too low level?  
The confusion effect is probably too random.
