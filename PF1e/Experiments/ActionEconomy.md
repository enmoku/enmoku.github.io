# Action Economy

## Remove Full Attack

Allow iterative attacks on standard attack.

**Rationale**: Disallowing iteratives is purely a nerf on martial classes that already "overpowered" casters do not suffer from because they can always move and cast or 5 foot step and cast with no penalty to casting, while martials can at best 5 foot step and full attack.

**Expected effect**: Martials are more deadly when they move and attack, or when they swap weapons and attack.

**Limitations**: Has no effect on charging.

**Backswing**: Classes that can combine casting and full attack do not get this when they cast a spell.

## Immediate Action Counterspelling

Allow counterspelling as immediate action.

**Rationale**: Who ever counterspells?

**Expected effect**: Counterspelling actually used.

**Limitations**: Range of 30 or 60 feet. Normal rules for longer range.

**Backswing**: Consume stamina equal to half the spell level that was countered.
