# Alternate Outcomes

## Fail Forward

If rolls are involved, *something* should always happen regardless of success or failure.

The general ideas for failing forward include: succeed at a cost, suffer a complication either game-wise or story-wise, or raise the stakes.

Simple examples: Succeed but your tool breaks, you injure yourself doing (not just hit points), you leave an obvious clue of your actions, someone raises the alarm (but doesn't yet know exactly where you are), you gain a new enemy, someone accidentally discharges a firearm from surprise, and so forth.

Breaking tools, crippling, etc. are rather harsh, so you may want to ask the player if they're okay with this. If they're not simply come up with some other result, one that probably is less favorable for them in the end, but still does not simply maintain status quo. If desirable or possible, ask the *player,* *before* rolling, what they think will happen if they fail. This will give extra agency to the player and it will also reduce stress of the roll, but it might be preferable for a particular group that the outcomes are more or less of a surprise.

I encourage to avoid failures that are comical, but not entirely omit them, since comical failures tend to promote play style where people don't care what happens as long as they have a laugh. Characterization, commitment, and other such things suffer. Of course, if you wish your game to be Monty Python, go for it.

## No True Death

For those who don't find PC death interesting, or are hyper allergic to PC death, the danger of "dying" can be restored by simply removing true death.

For a character that reaches negative hit points in excess of their negative Constitution, are unable to be revived during combat without Breath of Life or similar resurrection magic. The name of spells like Raise Dead and Resurrection should be changed to match this.

The "dead" character requires several treat deadly wounds to bring back to consciousness, they're treated to be in coma-like state until this is done and they require full rest after to regain functionality.

To make death feel more threatening, scarification or other semi-permanent debuffs should be considered. Scarification/crippling is sometimes received extremely poorly and should be co-operated on with players unless they state they're okay with such.
