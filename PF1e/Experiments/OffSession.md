# Off session

## End of Session activities

These are primarily meant for players to do.

### Wrap up and plan

Summarize what happened. Did you meet your goals? Did you work towards them? Do you even have goals? Did you make new enemies? What new did you learn? What did your party gain: equipment, allies, character points, etc.? What are your plans for the next session as a group? 

All this can be done in 5-10 minutes or so unless you had very busy session.

In some cases you may want to have a mini session between game sessions, something like 30 minutes to 1 hour, with the players alone discussing their plans and such.
