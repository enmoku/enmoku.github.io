## Description

This is re-imagining of the kobolds as they’re presented in the core rules.

## Abilities

**Ability Scores**: -2 Str, +2 Dex
**Optionally also**: -2 Con, +2 Cha

You gain *Draconic Aspect* or free bonus non-combat feat.

**Removed**: Light sensitivity. This should be particular to a sub-race. Kobolds appear on the surface at far too great regularity for light sensitivity to make sense. And this makes even less sense with their dragon ancestry.

## Qualities

**Weakling**: Kobolds are weak and defenseless, you suffer -2 penalty to CMD.

## Sub-races

Choose one of the following at level 1. You can spend a feat at any time to gain another you don’t already have.

**Draconic Flight**: You qualify for flight abilities. You have the gliding wings racial trait and gain the Draconic Glide feat.

**Draconic Might**: You gain bite and claws, each dealing 1d3 damage. You lose the racial strength penalty.

**Draconic Guile**: You swap Charisma bonus to Intelligence or Dexterity. You gain Draconic Breath as per the feat.

~~**Draconic Energy**: You lose the Dex bonus and Con penalty.~~

**Dragon Ogre**: You are much larger than your compatriots. You are medium instead of small, but suffer -2 penalty to Intelligence.

Additionally, you may choose the following

**Drake Devolution**: You suffer -2 penalty to intelligence and wisdom. You’re more afraid of things you don’t understand, things that are bigger than you. But you gain additional sub-race option.

## Feats
