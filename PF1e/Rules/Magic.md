Spell DC is always 10 + Â½ CL + Ability modifier on all spell levels.

## Schools

### Conjuration (Teleportation)

#### Dimensional fatigue

Can not teleport again by any spell willingly for 2d4 turns.

### Transmutation (Polymorph)

#### Buffering form

You gain temporary hit points equal to spell level plus new shape's Con modifier multiplied by 2 until you lose that shape.

## Alternate Casting

These are spellcaster specific changes.

**Rationale**: Early levels spellcasters are meh and late levels they tend to be too powerful.

### Overcasting

You can expend a higher level slot to overcast spells. You only need to know the base spell to overcast, regardless of your style of casting (prepared or spontaneous).

**Inspiration**: Intensified Metamagic

**Default guidelines** for what this does is as follows (per level increment), only one of these apply:

- Gains one additional increment of its effect if it has countable parts. For example Magic Missile cast at level 10 with level 2 slot would shoot 6 missiles.
- Gain 2 extra dice if the base spell has number of dice scaling. For example Shocking Grasp cast at level 3 with level 2 slot would cause 5d6 damage.
- Flat numeric effects increase by +4 if it's health based, +2 otherwise. For example Cure Light Wounds cast at level 3 with level 2 slot would heal 1d8+3+4.
- Duration increases as if your caster level was 1 higher even past normal limits if such exist.

**Backswing**: Increase casting time to full-round action if they aren't already that. 1 round casting time spells consume your move action from your next turn. Quickened spells can not be overcast.

**Backswing**: Consume all remaining stamina.

### Power Surge

**Inspiration**: Reckless magic use.

By voluntarily suffering 1d6+1 damage per level of the spell cast, you treat your caster level 1 higher.

You can expend at most your HD+3 number of dice this way per spell.

The caster level increase is negated if the damage is.

**Backwing**: Exchange one of the damage dice for 1 temporary negative level that is lost after 24 hours.

**Backswing**: Consume stamina equal to caster level increase.
