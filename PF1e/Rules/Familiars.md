# Familiars

Familiars are squishy and provide mostly role-playing oriented benefits. They are also commonly feared to be just killed for no good reason because apparently people just kill cats running around in middle of a fight?

## Common features

Gain Evasion at level 1 and Improved Evasion at level 3

Hit points are 5 per owner's character level, or using the original rule if that would give them more.

Able to speak and understand one language you know. This can not be changed without acquiring new familiar.

## New powers

### Drain Bonded Familiar

Drain Bonded Object is now part of familiars for classes that have that feature. You need the familiar to be adjacent to you to use this, but otherwise functions the same.

### Minor Magic

The familiar knows two level 0 spells. Once chosen these can not be changed (except by retraining or similar). The familiar casts them as if it's caster level was your character level.

### Lifelink

If the familiar takes damage that would kill it, you can divert portion of this damage to yourself instead.

## Revival

You gain use of Raise Familiar spell as long as you have a familiar.

### Raise Familiar

**Casting time**: 10 minutes

**Components**: V, S, M (50 gp per character level)

This functions like Raise Animal Companion but works only for your own familiar.
