| Feature              | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arcane Spell Failure | Gone. It no longer exists.                                   |
| Hit Dice             | HD is always maximized. Helps early levels and removes need to retrain HP, which is a strain mostly for martials who are more equipment dependent to begin with. |
| Racial HD            | Each race should grant small amount (4-6-ish) of HP to pad early level lethality. |
