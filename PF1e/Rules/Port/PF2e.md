| Feature                           | Explanation                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arcane Spell Failure              | Gone. It no longer exists. ASF is an arbitrary nerf to arcane casters which other full casters (cleric, druid, psychics, etc.) do not suffer from. It does nothing. Might be better to just say without going into partially martial build you just can’t do magic in heavy armor instead. |
| Hit Dice                          | HD is always maximized. Helps early levels and removes need to retrain HP, which is a strain mostly for martials who are more equipment dependent to begin with. |
| Racial HD                         | Each race should grant small amount (4-6-ish) of HP to pad early level lethality. |
|                                   |                                                              |
| Unarmed attacks don’t provoke AoO | It just never made any sense. It still doesn’t.              |

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Charge through allies | Movement through allies is not distinguished as different for purpose of charging. |
|                       |                                                              |
|                       |                                                              |
