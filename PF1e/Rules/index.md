# Rules

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

These are various homebrew rules I’ve made up. Some more viable than others.

## Notes

### New common terms:

- Backswing – a rule for counterbalancing a feature that might be a bit too powerful as is. Not meant to be used by default.
- New – In case something replaces something, then this covers that.
- Old – This explains how it worked before. For making sure you know what the actual change is.
- Rationale – I like explaining things. So these are for that when I feel like the reason a thing is introduced might not be clear.

### Other terms not unique to this:

- Guide – commonly referred to as Dungeon Master, Game Master, Space Master, and many many other things. Guide is sufficiently descriptive in their role and agnostic of the system and theme so it is the preferred name.

### Remarks

Things introduced with these are likely really broken when applied to some gimmicks. These are not made for those, but the general use cases. I do not Care to build rules around people who want to break rules, I will pointedly ignore such methods of thinking as they will not affect my games as I will quite simply tell them No, a skill all other guides should learn.
