## Combined Feats

| Feat         | Combined                                 | Rationale               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Power Strike | Power Attack, Piranha Strike, Deadly Aim | Why are these separate? |
|              |                                          |                         |
|              |                                          |                         |

## Changed Feats

| Feat             | Changes                                                      | Rationale                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Combat Expertise | Intelligence requirement is removed from this and followup feats. | Too niche for no good reason. |
| Stand Still      | Affects all threatened squares instead of only adjacent ones. |                               |
|                  |                                                              |                               |

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Combat Stamina             | Just too good system, and it doesn’t boost casters too much. |                               |
| Precise Shot               | Too necessary.                                               |                               |
|                            |                                                              |                               |
| Toughness                  | It’s a trap, and it buffs low level characters.              |                               |
| Dodge                      | It’s a trap, too much of a prereq for some chains.           |                               |
|                            |                                                              |                               |
| Power Strike               | Too necessary prerequisites                                  |                               |
| Weapon Finesse             | Dex is a problem, but feat taxing it is not a solution.      |                               |
| Combat Expertise           |                                                              |                               |
|                            |                                                              |                               |
| Improved Counterspell      | Who ever counterspells?                                      |                               |
| Rhino Charge               | Normally you can charge as standard action ONLY if you're limited to standard action.<br />Backswing: You can NOT move during your turn. | All prerequisites are waived. |
| Sycophant                  | It’s an option to grovel. Why is this a feat?                |                               |
