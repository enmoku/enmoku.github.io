# Fate Points

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

These are points that are supposed to be "better" hero points, to allow you more agency in your fate.

## Fate pool

You have by default pool of 3 points. This may be larger or smaller as your guide deems fit for the campaign or your circumstances in it.

This is not a hard maximum but decides what you start each session with.

Points in excess of this pool are by default lost at the end of the session.

## Recovery

You regain all missing fate points in your pool (3 by default) as established for your campaign at start of the session.

More can be gained during play, either through your actions, magic, or the guide simply saying so.

## Rule your fate

You can use your fate points in following ways, each use consumes by default only one (1) point.

### Options

- Reroll a d20 check. You must take the new result even if it's worse. You can do this only once per check.
- Reroll a d20 check. You take the better result. This costs you 2 fate points instead.
- +2 on a check at any point of a check before results are revealed.
- +1 on a check after the result has been revealed, but only if the guide offers this option.
- +1 AC against single attack.
- +2 stamina points.
- Stabilize or otherwise stave off death. This costs all your remaining fate points.
- Stop bleeding. This costs all your remaining fate points.
- Regain 1 hit point.
- Reduce damage from single instance by 2, to minimum of 1.

Although combining or stacking uses of fate points should be discouraged, it should not be disallowed as it is allowing players to simply heavily use their points on something they really want to influence.

## Examples of granting points

- Guide may offer player to voluntarily fail a course of action that they may not retry for one or more points.
- Player offers to lose something in exchange, for example one of their fairly high level spell slots, when such would matter.
- Player offers to have their equipment to break after performing an action they want the point for.
