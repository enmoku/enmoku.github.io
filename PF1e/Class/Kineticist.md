## Infusions

### Kinetic Blade

**Changes**: Burn 0 (normally 1)

**Rationale**: 1 burn for sacrificing damage from not being able to benefit from elemental overflow doesnâ€™t seem like a worthy expenditure.
**Context**: Kinetic Knight archetype gets this modification for free with nothing else relevant changed in regards to that (except maybe losing metakinesis which is really bad feature anyway). This also consumes infusion (the progress choice) and on the spot form infusion choice anyway.
**Problems?**: Archetypes that do something similar may feel a little less loved.
