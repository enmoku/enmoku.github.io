# Abilities

**By**: MKAh (Discord: Mana#4176)

These are free floating abilities not designed to be part of any particular race, class, or anything else. They're mostly ideas that could be granted as feats, corruption manifestations, templates, class feature replacements, or in place of other such things or in addition to such. Balance considerations are left mainly for the GM that chooses to adapt these rather than inbuilt, some balance suggestions may be included.
