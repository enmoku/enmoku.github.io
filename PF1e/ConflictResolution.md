# Conflict Resolution

These are alternative options to various conflict resolutions. Most of these favor narrative over mechanics.

## Narrative Driven (Narratively Bounded)

This requires your players are on board with this. Mostly suitable for co-operative storytelling than game experience.

Checks are used only as guidelines. Essentially take the total +bonus on a roll as baseline and the d20 roll as fudge.

DCs and ACs matter less in this, and you mostly go with what seems appropriate than what is matched by raw math.

**For example**:  
DC 20 gap that is reasonable for characters to jump across, one character has +15 acrobatics and rolls 10, they get across fine. Another has only +3 acrobatics and rolls 15, they get across fine also, another has +13 but roll 6, they get across fine but drop their lantern. The totals don't match with the DC compared to results here and the roll mattered a little bit more than usual. You could easily have the reverse where the roll matters less, but you could then roll smaller die even.

Grades of success are great addition to this.

## Grades of Success

Examples:

- Attack rolls, rolling up to 10 below target AC deals minimum damage.
- Acrobatics rolling up to 10 below target still succeeds but you drop something or take damage.

## Dramatic Reactions (Narrative Reactions)

Allow free immediate actions to react to certain events, such as catching a friend who tries to jump a gap that you just did, possibly with small consequences like taking damage, consuming a hero point, or the landing platform collapsing.
